***Project using Qt***

__Introduction__

This is a c++ gui program written using Qt widget toolkit.
This program uses UI to create two buttons where one of it when clicked opens a file with an image in it and the second button when clicked opens a file which can be edited or read only..
I have used the _modeless_ appraoch where the user can access both the windows which means once the image window is opened the user can go back to the mainwindow and open the file window simultaneously!

This is how the output screen looks at first:

Then clicking on the "window with an image" button this is the output:

When the user clicks the "window with a file" button he/she can edit and preview the text in the file..

It's amazing to find how every line in the code adds meaning to make 2 basic buttons!!
